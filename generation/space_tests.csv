A match on any of those names should constitute a consistency, and dwc:countryCode should not be needed to make this determination, that is, this test does not attempt to disambiguate potential duplicate first-level administrative division names. The level of buffering may be related to the scale of the underlying GIS layer being used. At a global scale, typical map scales used for borders and coastal areas are either 1:3M or 1:1M (Dooley 2005, Chapter 4). Horizontal accuracy at those scales is around 1.5-2.5km and 0.5-0.85 km respectively (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020).

Chapman and Wieczorek (2020) recommend best practice is to use EPSG codes (https://epsg.io) as a controlled vocabulary. Ideally, amend to the EPSG code for the geographic coordinate reference system (CRS), if known. Otherwise use the EPSG code for the geodetic datum, if known. Otherwise use the EPSG code of the ellipsoid, if known. If none of these is known, use the explicit value ""not recorded"". The reference vocabularies of values for geodetic datums and ellipsoids needs to be made available should map alternative representations of dwc:geodeticDatum strings to EPSG codes, such as ""WGS84"", ""WGS_84"", ""WGS:84"", ""WGS 84"" all with standard value ""epsg:4326"".","open","TG2 Amendment SPACE Test VOCABULARY Conformance"
